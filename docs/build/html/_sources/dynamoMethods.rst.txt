Dynamo Methods
==============
This section will list all available methods that you are able to chain onto your Dynamo object that you create inside your Dynamo Controller. For a very simple admin,
you might be able to get away with only using that auto() method which is auto-generated for you, and literally have no work to do. But in the case of a database relationship,
or the case of renaming a field in the form, or sizing a picture a specific way, etc, you need to use the methods below.

    <p><a name="method-addActionButton"></a></p>
    <h4><code>addActionButton()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>addField</code> method allows you to create a button along-side the other default action butons, Edit and Delete. Keep in mind these default buttons can be
       remove by calling hideDelete() or removeBoth().</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/addActionButton1.png
   :align: center

   Here we see the code, simply chain the function onto your Dynamo object in your Dynamo controller. addActionButton() takes one parameter which should be a closure function
   that return raw html for a link and bootstraps button classes. You can return any raw html you want; it doesn't have to be bootstrap, you could just use the button html tag.

.. thumbnail:: images/addActionButton2.png
   :align: center

   Here we see the test button alongside the other buttons, Edit and Delete, in the Action index.

    <p><a name="method-addField"></a></p>
    <h4><code>addField()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>addField</code> method is a bit tricky. You will never actually call this method directly. However, the Dynamo has a PHP magic method __call
       that calls addField. In the case where you use methods such as text(), file(), checkbox(), hasMany(), password(), select(), textarea(), you are actually
       just calling __call() in reality, which calls addField(). Now, you are free to create your own methods similar to the ones I just listed. You have to created
       them in the vendor->jzpeepz->dynamo->src->resources->views->partials->fields directory.</p>

    <p><a name="method-addFilter"></a></p>
    <h4><code>addFilter()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>addFilter</code> method is a brand new function in Dynamo that lets you filter the index view of an admin by whatever you want. We needed to implement
       this feature for our House of Representatives project because our client wanted to be able to "Filter" the Representatives by Terms. Terms and Representatives have
       a many-to-many relationship with each other in our database. See how we used addFilter below.</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/addFilter1.png
    :align: center

      Here is where we called addFilter on the DynamoController. The parameters are the database field you want to filter by(in this case terms), a collection
      of the objects(in this case, we grabbed all terms names and sorted them in descending order), then a closure function that actually does the filtering. In
      this case, depending on what term you choose, we will grab all the Representatives from that term.

.. thumbnail:: images/addFilter2.png
    :align: center

    Filtered by Term 2222

.. thumbnail:: images/addFilter3.png
    :align: center

    Filtered by term 2016

    <p><a name="method-addHandler"></a></p>
    <h4><code>addHandler()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>addHandler</code> method is called by default in your DynamoController and will auto-populate the form
       with text boxes for each field in the database for that object.</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/auto3.png
 :align: center

 Auto function being called on the newly created Dynamo object.

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-addIndex"></a></p>
    <h4><code>addIndex()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>addIndex</code> method allows you to add a new column to the index view of your module. This method takes up to
       three parameters, but only passing one is necessary. The first parameter is the name of the field in your database. The second
       is the how you want the name to appear in the index view. The third is a closure function to do something specific. Notice
       in the examples below of cases where addIndex is used with one, two, and three parameters and their outputs on the index view.</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/addIndex1.png
    :align: center

    In the closure function, we are checking to see if this Representative has a Headshot photo in the database or not. If not, just display an empty string.
    If so, display their image with a certain width.

.. thumbnail:: images/addIndex2.png
    :align: center

    The first three Representatives did not have pictures, the fourth did.

.. thumbnail:: images/addIndex3.png
    :align: center

    The third addIndex uses a closure that uses a ternary operation to check if this Alert is activated. If so, a success box is rendered with the word "Yes" in it.
    If not, a danger box is rendered with the word "No" in it.

    <p><a name="method-addIndexButton"></a></p>
    <h4><code>addIndexButton()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>addIndexButton</code> method allows you to add a button along side the Add button in your Dynamo Manager. One example of where you would want to use addIndexButton
       would be if you wanted to minimize the amount of modules in your navigation. Below is an example:</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/addIndexButton1.png
   :align: center

   Here, in the top right corner, we add a button in the Representatives Manager that says Import Representatives from Spreadsheet that links to
   another form for uploading Representatives via .csv.

.. thumbnail:: images/addIndexButton2.png
   :align: center

   This is the page the button links to

.. thumbnail:: images/addIndexButton3.png
   :align: center

   This is the function in use. It takes one parameter that is a closure function that returns raw html linking to that page.

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-auto"></a></p>
    <h4><code>auto()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>auto</code> method is called by default in your DynamoController and will auto-populate the form
       with text boxes for each field in the database for that object, and will automatically set the index view with those same fields.</p>


.. thumbnail:: images/auto3.png
    :align: center

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-checkbox"></a></p>
    <h4><code>checkbox()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>checkbox</code> method lets you add a checkbox to your form. It is particularly useful if you have a boolean attribute for an object in your database.
       For example, we used checkboxes on our House of Representatives website to allow the user to "Activate" Faq's and Alerts, as seen in the screenshots below.</p>


.. thumbnail:: images/checkbox1.png
    :align: center

    A checkbox method is called here, with an array of options containing one option, 'label', so let the user know that they can only activate one Alert at a time.

.. thumbnail:: images/checkbox2.png
    :align: center

    The result on the form for Alerts.

.. thumbnail:: images/checkbox3.png

    The result on the index view for Alerts.

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-clearIndexes"></a></p>
    <h4><code>clearIndexes()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>clearIndexes</code> method will remove all the columns that are generated from the auto() function that is at
       the top of the DynamoController by default. After calling clearIndexes, you will certainly want to call addIndex right after.
       Notice the examples below.</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/clearIndexes1.png
    :align: center

    I've commented out my addIndex() calls for the sake of demonstration. The next image shows the result.

.. thumbnail:: images/clearIndexes2.png
    :align: center

.. thumbnail:: images/clearIndexes3.png

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-file"></a></p>
    <h4><code>file()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>file</code> method will allow the user to select a file from their computer when filling out the form for this field. Let's say you have a Staff module
       and you want the user to be able create Staff "objects" with their name, and photo. Check out the example below.</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/file1.png
    :align: center

    Notice the file method call.

.. thumbnail:: images/file2.png
    :align: center

    This is the result for the form view. The user can select the photo from their computer.

.. thumbnail:: images/file3.png
    :align: center

    This is the result of the index view.

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-group"></a></p>
    <h4><code>group()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>group</code> method is called by default in your DynamoController and will auto-populate the form
       with text boxes for each field in the database for that object.</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/auto3.png
    :align: center

    <p><a name="method-hasMany"></a></p>
    <h4><code>hasMany()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>hasMany</code> method is called by default in your DynamoController and will auto-populate the form
       with text boxes for each field in the database for that object, and will automatically set the index view with those same fields.</p>


.. thumbnail:: images/auto3.png
    :align: center

    Auto function being called on the newly created Dynamo object.

.. thumbnail:: images/auto1.png
    :align: center

    The index view auto() produces for Faqs.

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-hasManySimple"></a></p>
    <h4><code>hasManySimple()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>hasManySimple</code> method is used when you want the user to be able to "multi-select" another object that is related to this object. For example, a
       common database relationship on websites might be: "FAQs have many FAQ Categories, and FAQ Categories have many FAQs". If you have made this relationship in your
       database using foreign keys and such, then you can use this method. First go to the model of FAQ and add a public function that says FAQs belongToMany FAQ Categories,
       and go to the model of the FAQ Category and do the same. Next, you will be able to chain on the hasManySimple() function on the FAQ DynamoController! Check out the
       example below.</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/hasManySimple1.png
    :align: center

    First, make sure you have created the relationship your in database migrations.

.. thumbnail:: images/hasManySimple2.png
    :align: center

    Next, make sure both your models have a public function that relates the two.

.. thumbnail:: images/hasManySimple3.png
    :align: center

.. thumbnail:: images/hasManySimple4.png
    :align: center

    Now, on the controller, you can call hasManySimple() and the first parameter should be named EXACTLY the way you named in on the model in the previous steps.

.. thumbnail:: images/hasManySimple5.png
    :align: center

    This is the result on the form. The user is able to select many categories for each FAQ they make.

.. thumbnail:: images/hasManySimple6.png
    :align: center

    And when they submit the form, your database will create the relationship between this FAQ_id and that FAQ Category_id.

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-hideAdd"></a></p>
    <h4><code>hideAdd()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>hideAdd</code> method simply hides the Add button, so the user isn't able to add new objects/items into the database. You would use this
       if you wanted them to be able to view, edit, and delete the items, but not add new items. You could also use the hideDelete() method in combination with this method.</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/hideAdd1.png
    :align: center

    First I comment add hideAdd() to show the default.

.. thumbnail:: images/hideAdd2.png
    :align: center

    Notice that the add FAQ Category button exist in the top right corner of the container by default.

.. thumbnail:: images/hideAdd3.png
    :align: center

    Now I uncomment hideAdd(), ...

.. thumbnail:: images/hideAdd4.png
    :align: center

    Now the FAQ Category button isn't available to the user so they can't create new FAQ Categories.

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-hideDelete"></a></p>
    <h4><code>hideDelete()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>hideDelete</code> method simply hides the delete button on the index view, so the user will not be able to delete the
       object/item from the database.</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/hideDelete1.png
    :align: center

    First I just took a basic DynamoController and commented out the hideDelete() function to show the default.

.. thumbnail:: images/hideDelete2.png
    :align: center

    Notice you have an Edit/Delete button by default under your Action index

.. thumbnail:: images/hideDelete3.png
    :align: center

    Now I uncomment hideDelete(), ...

.. thumbnail:: images/hideDelete4.png
    :align: center

    And the delete button is hidden. Magical isn't it?

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-indexOrderBy"></a></p>
    <h4><code>indexOrderBy()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>indexOrderBy</code> method is how you order all the objects in the index view. Commonly, you might order by last name or by date created.
       By default, it orders in ascending order, you can pass a second parameter of 'desc' if you'd like to reverse it.</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/indexOrderBy1.png
    :align: center

    In this case, rather than indexOrderBy('last_name'), we made it where the user could drag-and-drop the staff members in the order they would like in the index view.
    Wherever they dropped the Staff member, it would update that staff members position in the database. Then we can just indexOrderBy('position').

    <p><a name="method-password"></a></p>
    <h4><code>password()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>password</code> method will remove all the columns that are generated from the auto() function that is at
       the top of the DynamoController by default. After calling clearIndexes, you will certainly want to call addIndex right after.
       Notice the examples below.</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/clearIndexes1.png
    :align: center

    I've commented out my addIndex() calls for the sake of demonstration. The next image shows the result.

.. thumbnail:: images/clearIndexes2.png

    <p><a name="method-removeBoth"></a></p>
    <h4><code>removeBoth()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>removeBoth</code> method is called by default in your DynamoController and will auto-populate the form
       with text boxes for each field in the database for that object.</p>

    <p><a name="method-removeField"></a></p>
    <h4><code>removeField()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>removeField</code> method removes any field that you pass it from the index view. This method is needed when the auto() function
       adds a field you don't want the user to see. A common case of using removeField would be like in the indexOrderBy example, where we order staff members
       by position. But we don't actually want the user to be able to set the position manaully within the form. So we removeField('position'). They update the
       position by drag-and-drag in that case. Check it out below</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/indexOrderBy1.png
    :align: center

    See how we remove the position field in the form. We don't want the user to have to fill that out in the form because they are able to drag-and-drop staff members
    to set the position in the index view.

.. thumbnail:: images/indexOrderBy2.png
    :align: center

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-removeIndex"></a></p>
    <h4><code>removeIndex()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>removeIndex</code> method is exactly the same as removeField right above this. The only difference is you are removing an a column from the index
       view that was automatically added by the auto() function. Usually, we don't see this function since we use clearIndexes() and addIndex() to start from scratch anyways.
       But in the case that auto() is doing everything you need it to do minus one pesky index you don't want to see in the index view, removeIndex is less code to type than
       starting from scratch.</p>

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-searchable"></a></p>
    <h4><code>searchable()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>searchable</code> method allows you to define with parts of the model are searchable. The parameter you
       pass into this function must be the name of the field in the database that you want to be searchable in the search
       bar. For example, if you have an admin called Representatives, and you want to have a search bar where the user can search
       for staff members by their first and last name you might chain on the searchable method twice:
       </p>

.. thumbnail:: images/searchable1.png
    :align: center

    Here we call searchable twice for first and last name.

.. thumbnail:: images/searchable2.png
    :align: center

    Here we see you can search by last_name

.. thumbnail:: images/searchable3.png
    :align: center

    Here we see you can search by first_name

.. thumbnail:: images/searchable4.png
    :align: center

    Here we see search working for first and last name at the same time.

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-select"></a></p>
    <h4><code>select()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>select</code> method will allow the user to use a select box and select a single item. When you use the select method, your second parameter
       will be an array all the options they have to select from.</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/select1.png
    :align: center

    Notice that we have three selects on this Program DynamoController. The user may optionally select categories to connect to this program they are creating.
    This way, on the front-end of the website, they will see FAQ's related to this program in a sidebar when they are on this programs page.

.. thumbnail:: images/select2.png
    :align: center

    This is the form view that the user will interact with.

.. thumbnail:: images/select3.png

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

    <p><a name="method-text"></a></p>
    <h4><code>text()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>text</code> method is probably the simplest Dynamo method. It makes a textbox on the form for the given database field. Now, you can of course pass
       in other parameters as you can with all Dynamo methods. Check out some of the examples below.</p>

.. thumbnail:: images/text1.png
    :align: center

    The simplest example.

.. thumbnail:: images/text2.png
    :align: center

    The result on the form.

.. thumbnail:: images/text3.png
    :align: center

    In this example, we pass in an array of options with only one option, that being 'position'. The position option is there so you can manually set the order
    of the fields in the form if needed. The auto() function usually handles this, but in some cases you may want to reorder.

.. thumbnail:: images/text4.png
    :align: center

    The result.

.. thumbnail:: images/text5.png
    :align: center

    A more complicated example. Here we pass in an option to the top two text fields. This option is 'class' => 'dateTimePicker' which lets a little calendar pop
    up to aid the user in selected the dates for the these fields. And I'm not even going to explain what's going on in the third text field. It was a super weird case,
    usually things don't look that messy.

    <p><a name="method-textarea"></a></p>
    <h4><code>textarea()</code></h4>
    <p>The <code>textarea</code> method is just like the text() method, except it's a bigger text box on the form. In many of our websites, we pass in a class
       called "wysiwyg editor" which stands for "What You See Is What You Get", and it allows the user to make html code without having to actually code. Check it
       out.</p>
