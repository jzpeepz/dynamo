What is Dynamo?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


**Dynamo** is a |package| you can use in your existing PHP |laravel| framework application to build admins. Dynamo is especially useful if
you want to create your own custom CMS (content management system).

.. |package| raw:: html

  <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/jzpeepz/dynamo" target="_blank">package</a>

.. |laravel| raw:: html

   <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.7" target="_blank">Laravel</a>

It allows you to create a controller, model, migration, and route for your admin with one command:

.. code-block:: php

   php artisan make:dynamo Employee

After running this you will notice an autogenerated route in your routes->web.php file. You will notice a new database migration
has been created in your database->migrations directory. You will notice a new model made in your app directory.
You will notice a new Dynamo Controller in your controller directory. This controller is specifically designed for creating
admins with ease. By default the controller directory is set in your config file::

   'controller_namespace' => 'App\Http\Controllers',

   'controller_path' => app_path('/Http/Controllers'),

Need to opt out of some of the Dynamo magic?

.. code-block:: PHP

   php artisan make:dynamo Employee --migration=no --model=no --controller=no --route=no
