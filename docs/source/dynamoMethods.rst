Dynamo Methods
==============
This section will list all available methods that you are able to chain onto your Dynamo object that you create inside your Dynamo Controller. For a very simple admin,
you might be able to get away with only using that auto() method which is auto-generated for you, and literally have no work to do. But in the case of a database relationship,
or the case of renaming a field in the form, or sizing a picture a specific way, etc, you need to use the methods below.

+------------+------------+-----------+
| Method     | Header 2   | Header 3  |

+------------+ span rows. | - contain |
| body row 4 |            | - blocks. |
